<br>

My name is Kamal Hegazi, a second-year CSIT student at the Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology (E-JUST) with a deep passion for information technology, cybersecurity, and competitive programming. I enjoy solving complex technical problems and continuously push myself to grow through hands-on learning, collaboration, and competitive environments.
I was a member of Team W4llz for eight months, where I actively participated in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and contributed as a security content writer. During this time, I competed in several international events, including SekaICTF 2025 and CrewCTF 2025, with a focus on web exploitation, reverse engineering, and OSINT. I particularly enjoy creating detailed technical write-ups that explain attack vectors and defensive mechanisms in a clear and accessible way, helping others learn advanced security concepts.
Alongside cybersecurity, I am a competitive programmer with Team Mission Semicolon, where I have strengthened my algorithmic thinking, problem-solving skills, and teamwork under high-pressure conditions. Our team’s qualification for ECPC 2025 reflects our dedication, disciplined preparation, and commitment to continuous improvement.
I currently work as a Security Content Engineer at MetaCTF, contributing to the design of CTF challenges and the creation of educational cybersecurity content and hands-on learning experiences. My role includes developing innovative challenges, writing structured learning materials for students of all levels, and collaborating on projects that bridge theoretical knowledge with real-world security practices. I am also involved in community outreach and mentorship, supporting others through workshops and tutorials to help them sharpen their cybersecurity skills.
My long-term goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical cybersecurity applications. My interests span ethical hacking, system and network security, cryptography, and applied defense techniques. I aspire to contribute to the cybersecurity community through research, technical writing, challenge development, and building secure and innovative systems.
